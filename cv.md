## Personal qualities

I am interested in Forth and Zig, I like their design philosophy and the way to approach problems they suggest.

I watch presentations on architecture design and development from conferences, read technical blogs.

I can’t give out quick, half-baked and ill-conceived solutions, it’s important for me to understand how things works internally, to be responsible for the implementations that I create.

If there is a complex problem, the approach to which is not clear, and it is at the intersection of algorithms, design and research, I can immerse myself in reading preprints and publications.
